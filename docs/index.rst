Welcome to pyretrievals's documentation!
========================================

Introduction
------------

ARTS_ is the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator. Thanks to the Typhon_ project, we have useful tools for
atmospheric sciences and also a python interface to ARTS itself, via `typhon.arts.workspace`.
Modules in this package build on these projects and create an interface for simple simulations and retrievals.

Currently this is limited to ground based microwave measurements but might also be useful for other things, let me know!
